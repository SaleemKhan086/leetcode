Do it in two iterations.
In first iteration, traverse the string and check if all the open paranthesis have closing paranthesis including stars.
In second iteration, traverse the string in reverse and check if all the closing paranthesis have opening paranthesis including stars.

Time Complexity : `O(n)`
Space Complexity: `O(1)`
